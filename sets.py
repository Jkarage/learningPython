#A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed.
vendor_set ={"Cisco","HPE/Aruba","Juniper","Huawei","Arista"}

#Access items

for items in vendor_set:
    print(items)

#Checking if an item exists in a set
print("Cisco" in vendor_set)

#Items can't be changed

#Adding an item
vendor_set.add("VMware")

#To add multiple,use update
vendor_set.update("RiverBed","Netscout")

#Removing an item
vendor_set.discard("Cisco")

#emptying the set
